Enhancement: Support cold storages

Restic used to access the repository regularly for config, locks and
metadata preventing it to work in combination with "cold storages".
We've added an option to specify a "hot repository" which saves a copy
of metadata, config and locks and is used to read those files.
This allows many restic commands to work with cold storages.
